# BasicAerodynamics
Code for class 46110 Basic Aerodynamics at Technical University of Denmark.

## Assignment1: Airfoil contours
Use the Joukowsky and Kármán-Trefftz (K-T) transformations to generate airfoil contours of different thickness and camber, and to compute the resulting pressure distributions and flow field around these airfoils at different angles of attack.

## Assignment2: Lifting-line theory
The purpose of this assignment is to use lifting-line theory to determine the aerodynamics properties of planar wings.

## Assignment3: Conceptual Drone
The purpose of this assignment is to make a conceptual aerodynamic  design of a drone, which is capable of mapping mines in former war zones using magnetometers. The drone is to be designed with two identical rotors in the center body to provide the lift force in climb and two propellers at the wing tips to provide the forward motion.
